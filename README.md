# BPoCiT Planning

Different communities have different needs, some of them have smaller wishes, others have bigger ones. Along our way at conferences, meet-ups, workshops, community activities and other events, we noticed that we want to team up to start projects together where we can:

- Learn all the great tools, technologies and skills and grow together
- Match one community need per project (even if it is a small one)
- Extend our network of Black and People of Color in Tech and friends

This repo is just the beginning and a good start to keep an overview of our notes, documents and ideas for upcoming projects. Get in touch with us if you are interested to join us or have ideas how to collaborate.
