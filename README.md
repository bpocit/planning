# BPoCiT Planning

## N00tes

Different communities have different needs, some of them have smaller wishes, others have bigger or urgent ones. Along our way at conferences, meet-ups, workshops, community activities and other events, we noticed that we want to team up to start projects together where we can:

- Learn all the great tools, technologies and skills and grow together
- Match one community need per project (even if it is a small one)
- Extend our network of other Black and People of Color in Tech (BPoCiT) and friends

This repo is just the beginning and a good start for documenting our notes and ideas for upcoming projects. Get in touch with us if you are interested to join us or have ideas how to collaborate.
